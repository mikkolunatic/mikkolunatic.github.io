<h1>Coloring pages</h1>
<p>If you can't have too much coloring pages in life, here's your section! From well known characters to original designs, you can print them out and enjoy some stress-free coloring time! I will announce new pages on my social medias! Don't forget to send me a message with the final result! ðŸ˜‰ <br><br> <i>The pages are scaled at letter format (8.5 in x 11 in).</i></p>
<div class="photo-gallery">
  <div class="row">
    {% for file in page.files %}
