Hi and welcome to my new website! I am so thrilled to publish this since it will be my first blog post here AND the release of my brand new website. I have exciting stuff coming up soon that I cannot wait to share with you all.

Since I graduated from design school I started my career in Web development and UX/UI design. As much as I love my job, I still needed this creative space where I could express myself and create what I want. Sadly, I was trapped in a state where I felt very uninspired and unmotivated about art. So, I was focusing on my career and slowly pushed away my hobbies...

For probably a good 3-4 months now I have been diving into some early 2000's/1990's pop aesthetic. I discovered it thanks to a pop indie artist named LIZ (I will soon make a blog post about it ðŸ¥°). It hit me. I felt very inspired by all the visuals she was creating and started digging further into this whole Y2K aesthetic. I created a Pinterest board and even found old ads/designs I remembered seeing in my childhood. Nostalgia was hitting me like a train and this spark I was striving to re-ignite came back.

So, prepare to see some designs inspired by this era! Even some merch is coming soon!


See you later,

Mikael
